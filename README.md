## ⚡ Fun Fact

I once debugged a production issue while hiking up a mountain. My laptop battery died just as I committed the fix, and I had to sprint down to civilization before the servers caught fire. They didn't, but my legs were on fire instead. Worth it. Now I always carry a power bank... and snacks.
