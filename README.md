## 🚀 DevOps Engineer | Cloud Enthusiast | Automation Advocate

I turn coffee into infrastructure and chaos into orchestrated systems. When servers misbehave, I'm the therapist they didn't know they needed.

### 🛠️ Tech Toolbox

$ cat skills.json | jq .

  "Networking": ["VPC", "Subnets", "Security Groups", "Load Balancing"]
}
```
